# Chat_With_Multiple_PDF
Chat PDF with Gemini: An interactive Streamlit app that enables users to query PDF files using Google Generative AI. It extracts text from PDFs, splits it into chunks, and creates a searchable vector store with FAISS. The app then uses a conversational chain to provide accurate responses to user questions.
